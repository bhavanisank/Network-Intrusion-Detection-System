# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Given a Network Traffic Dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model that can accurately classify each network connection as either normal or malicious. The model should be  able to identify different types of attacks such as Denial Of Service(DOS), Probe, User To Root(U2R) and Remote To Local (R2L) attacks.

# Description

This Project introduces a network-based intrusion detection system (IDS) developed on the KDD Cup dataset. The IDS utilizes various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression for classification purposes. Performance evaluation of the IDS models revealed that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, while Decision Tree exhibited the fastest prediction times. Moreover, SVM and Logistic Regression demonstrated competitive performance. These findings contribute to network security research and assist in choosing suitable algorithms for specific security needs.
