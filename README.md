# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
Given a Network Traffic Dataset, Develop a Machine Learning Model that can accurately classify each network connection as either normal or malicious. The model should be  able to identify different types of attacks such as Denial Of Service(DOS), Probe, User To Root(U2R) and Remote To Local (R2L) attacks.
